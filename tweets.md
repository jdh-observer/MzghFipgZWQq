At the Journal of Digital History, we ensure articles are reproducible—but this comes at a cost: time. Analysing 16 articles since 2021, we found that technical review & peer reviewer acquisition significantly extend timelines. #AcademicPublishing

Reproducible digital history scholarship takes up to 280 days to publish, mainly due to technical review & specialized code implementation. Our workflow prioritizes scientific rigor but adds complexity. #DigitalHistory

We’re working to shorten publication timelines while keeping scientific rigor. Steps include switching to OJS, improving editorial resources & optimizing workflows—all while maintaining reproducibility standards. #ScholarlyPublishing

A major challenge: peer reviewer recruitment. Each manuscript requires outreach to up to 14 reviewers! We plan to introduce new incentives, though we recognize the reviewer crisis persists. #AcademicResearch

Last but not least: We’re developing version 3 (beta) of our publication platform with an improved UI, direct code execution inside articles & AI-assisted code interpretation. #DigitalHumanities
