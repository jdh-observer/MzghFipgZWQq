At the Journal of Digital History, we are ensuring that the articles we publish are reproducible. This has a cost: substantial time investment. Our analysis of 16 of the articles we have published since 2021 demonstrates significant duration in technical review processes and peer reviewer acquisition. #AcademicPublishing

This analysis indicates publication timelines for reproducible digital history scholarship extend up to 280 days, primarily due to technical review requirements and specialized code implementation. Our comprehensive workflow ensures scientific rigor. #DigitalHistory

We are trying to make this publication timeline shorter, without giving up on scientific rigor, notably through a switch to the OJS platform, better editorial resources to optimize publication efficiency while maintaining reproducibility standards. #ScholarlyPublishing

Furthermore, our experience shows significant challenges in peer reviewer recruitment, necessitating outreach to up to 14 potential reviewers per manuscript. We will implement new incentive structures, but we are aware that there is a general reviewer crisis. #AcademicResearch

Last but not least, we are currently developing a version 3 (beta) of the design of our publication platform, with enhanced interface that facilitates direct code execution within articles and provides AI-assisted code interpretation. #DigitalHumanities
